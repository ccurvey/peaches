This is a portfolio/personal project.  On the portfolio side, I use it
when working with new employers or customers so that they can see a bit of
my coding style.

I use this personal project as a notebook of information that is useful when
gambling on the college basketball tournament.  (Which I will not name here
because of overzealous copyright and trademark attorneys.)

There are (currently) two pages in the system.  The "history" page lists
the season history for a matchup between two teams.  The "preview" page lists
the predicted score from a number of different algorithms.

Note that this site will not work without the underlying data, which is
available for purchase from www.bbstate.com.
